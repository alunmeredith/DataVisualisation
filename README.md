## Courseworks

### CW1: Critical Essay ([Specification](https://github.com/alunmeredith/DataVisualisation/blob/master/IndividualCoursework/Specification.pdf) [Report](https://github.com/alunmeredith/DataVisualisation/blob/master/IndividualCoursework/report.pdf) Grade: 29/30)

This coursework aimed to find at least three visualisations and analyse the strengths and weeknesses of those visualisations, why they are worthy of interst, what their narrative context is, etc. 

Feedback:
"You've made a brilliant choice in Case 1.  This was a great visualisation, and your comments were fair and balanced.  You integrated theoretical generarilities well but your attention to design issues is most impressive.  The critiques in the second example were brief and pertinent, and I liked the context-setting within the article in which the diagram appears.  The need for guidance in a display that requires intervention to find information is well made as is the possibility of enabling similarly exploratory displays but with a non-animated display. I also liked the references in Case 3 to other visualisations that inspired this design.  The remarks about changing gun deaths shouwed engagement."

### CW2: Tableau Group coursework ([Specification](https://github.com/alunmeredith/DataVisualisation/blob/master/TableuxCoursework/Specification.pdf) [Report](https://github.com/alunmeredith/DataVisualisation/blob/master/TableuxCoursework/report.pdf) Grade: 80/100)
This coursework used Tableau to analyse a dataset, producing a number of visualisations linked into a dashboard to describe a narrative and consistent visual design and interactivity.
